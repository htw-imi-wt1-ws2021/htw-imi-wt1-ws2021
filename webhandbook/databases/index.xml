Relational databases derive from the idea of simple tables. Every row in the table is then called a dataset or tuple; its columns hold the so-called attributes of the datasets. Relations between tables can be expressed by using the same identifier (ID) or a combination of attributes for a dataset in different tables, this is also referred to as a key.</description></item><item><title>1 History and Terminology</title><link>/webhandbook/databases/_1_/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/webhandbook/databases/_1_/</guid><description>Functionalities of databases in web applications Interacting with a web application means sending requests to a server which then retrieves data to display. The server will also handle new data that is created while using the application as well as alterations on the existing data. Since these tasks can become quite complex, the server itself is not the optimal place to handle them. Therefore, elaborate operations on data and displaying dynamic data should be performed by a suitable database software (Williams and Lane, 2006).</description></item></channel></rss>
