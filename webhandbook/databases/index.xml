The server will also handle new data that is created while using the application as well as alterations on the existing data. Since these tasks can become quite complex, the server itself is not the optimal place to handle them. Therefore, elaborate operations on data and displaying dynamic data should be performed by a suitable database software (Williams and Lane, 2006).</description></item><item><title>2 SQL databases</title><link>/webhandbook/databases/_2_/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/webhandbook/databases/_2_/</guid><description>SQL stands for structured query language and is used for querying relational databases. Relational databases derive from the idea of simple tables. Every row in the table is then called a dataset or tuple; its columns hold the so-called attributes of the datasets. Relations between tables can be expressed by using the same identifier (ID) or a combination of attributes for a dataset in different tables, this is also referred to as a key.</description></item><item><title>3 NoSQL databases</title><link>/webhandbook/databases/_3_/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/webhandbook/databases/_3_/</guid><description>Web services that operate in real time and process diverse datasets pose a challenge when it comes to storage (Kaufmann and Meier, 2019). In these cases, NoSQL databases can provide a solution: They are easily scalable, allow fast querying and are said to make work for developers easier (Schaefer, 2021). Unlike what one might expect, the “No” in NoSQL stands for “not only”.
The rigid structures of traditional relational databases can be limiting for certain kinds of data and sometimes not all features of relational databases are needed (Lai, 2009).</description></item><item><title>4 Finding the right database for an application</title><link>/webhandbook/databases/_4_/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/webhandbook/databases/_4_/</guid><description>There is no one correct choice when it comes to selecting a database for a web application. Instead, the data itself and how it is accessed should be the main points to consider (Macedo and Oliveira, 2012). Macedo and Oliveira (2012) state that in general, SQL databases can be used for “stable, predictable and relational data” while NoSQL databases should be considered when handling “temporary, highly dynamic data” (p. 2).</description></item><item><title>5 References</title><link>/webhandbook/databases/_5_/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/webhandbook/databases/_5_/</guid><description>Da Silva, M.
