The server will also handle new data that is created while using the application as well as alterations on the existing data. Since these tasks can become quite complex, the server itself is not the optimal place to handle them. Therefore, elaborate operations on data and displaying dynamic data should be performed by a suitable database software (Williams and Lane, 2006).</description></item></channel></rss>
